        <h2>How to make this italian classic</h2>
             <p>Ahh ragu, lovely stuff. Stick to the ribs with a glass of chianti beautiful. Learn how to make this northern Italian classic.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>60g butter</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                    <li>60g smoked pancetta</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
                    <li>1 small carrot, finely diced</li>
                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                    <li>400g 10% fat beef, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp tomato puree</li>
                    <li>150ml red wine, ideally chianti</li>
                    <li>2 pinches grated nutmeg</li>
                    <li>150ml rich beef stock</li>
                    <li>150ml whole milk</li>
                    <li>Sea salt and ground pepper to season</li>
                    <li>Papardelle, to serve</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the butter and oil in a heavy-based saucepan. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then remove it. Add the pancetta and cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the onion and, when it begins to soften, stir in the carrot, celery and bay. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef, turn the heat up to high and cook until medium-brown and nearly crisp, crumbling it in the pot using a fork. You need a high heat so that the meat browns rather than stews, but be careful not to let it become too brown and hard.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato purée and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine, nutmeg and stock. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to very low, so that the mixture reduces very slowly.</li>
                    <li>Set the lid askew over the pan and cook for about 2 hours, adding a couple of tablespoons of milk from time to time. By the end all the milk should have been added and absorbed, and the ragù should be rich with the texture of thick soup.</li>
                    <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning. The ragù is now ready. Boil the tagliatelle and serve with the ragù.</li>
                </ol>
